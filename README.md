# TA_laurel

A Splunk Technical Addon for [the LAUREL plugin for Linux Auditd](https://github.com/threathunters-io/laurel).

This Technical Addon aims to take the JSON output from the LAUREL plugin for Auditd and map it to the Splunk-supported datamodels using the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM).

The aim of this Technica Addon is to allow for easy use of the [Splunk Security Content](https://github.com/splunk/security_content) with data collected from Auditd on Linux.
